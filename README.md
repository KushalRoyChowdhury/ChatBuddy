    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## 🛠️ How the Memory System Works

ChatBuddy uses a dual-model architecture. A helper model manages memory based on your conversation.

**Helper Model Actions**:
```json
{
  "action": "remember",
  "target": ["User's name is Alex."]
}
```
-   `"action"`: Can be `remember`, `forget`, `update`, or `temp`.
-   `"target"`: The information to act upon.

You can view and manage permanent memories from the `Saved Memories` modal.

> Memory is managed by model `gemma3-12b`.
