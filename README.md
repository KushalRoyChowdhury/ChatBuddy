## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

This project is built with a modern and powerful tech stack:

-   **Frontend**:
    -   **React**: For building the user interface.
    -   **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling.
    -   **Framer Motion**: For smooth and beautiful animations.
-   **Backend**:
    -   Node.js with Express.
    -   @google/genai SDK

## üöÄ Getting Started

To use ChatBuddy locally, you'll need to set up both the frontend and the backend. For self-hosting with cloud sync capabilities, which is powered by the Google Drive API, a Google Cloud project with OAuth credentials is required.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (which includes npm)
-   A running instance of the ChatBuddy backend server.

### Frontend Setup (This Repository)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KushalRoyChowdhury/ChatBuddy
    cd chatbuddy-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend Setup

The backend server is required for the AI to function.

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    (Assuming you are in the `ChatBuddy` directory from the previous step)
    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The backend server will start, typically on port `8000`. The frontend is pre-configured to communicate with the backend on this port.



## ü§ñ AI Models & API Keys

**Powered by the official Google AI SDK (`@google/genai`).**

ChatBuddy is designed to be flexible and powerful, giving you control over your AI experience.

### Public Version and Privacy (This information is not applicable if self-hosting)

On the hosted version, the app works without providing any keys but has strict rate limits to ensure fair use for everyone. For a significantly better experience, it is **highly recommended** to use your own free Gemini API key.


| Feature               | Without Personal Key (Free Tier)           | With Personal Key (Free Tier)                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Context Window**    | Basic: 6k / Advanced: 64k                  | Basic: 6k / *Advanced: 128k*                    |
| **Rate Limits (RPM)** | Basic: 7 / Advanced: 3 / Image Gen: 3      | Basic: 30 / Advanced: 15 / Image Gen: 10        |
| **Rate Limits (RPD)** | Basic: 500 / Advanced: 100 / Image Gen: 25 | Basic: 14,350 / Advanced: 1000 / Image Gen: 100 |

> **NOTE:** *Context Window sizes are only for chat history. Memories, System Prompts and other Referencing features are not counted towards the mentioned limits.*

> Your own API key limits are shown according to Google‚Äôs free quota *(Updated: September 2025)*.

> **Privacy and Data Handling Policy (Public Hosted)**: None of your chats, memories, KEYs are logged/stored on the server. All data stays between you and API service provider. For more details read [Google ToS](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms). If you use the File Upload feature, the files will be stored for next 48 hours from uploading in Google Cloud Project (based on [Google Cloud Files Policy](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/files)). All your  Google login Credentials are stored locally in your device. 


**How to get your key:**
1.  Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com).
2.  Click "Create API key".
3.  Copy the key and paste it into the "Gemini API Key" field in the [ChatBuddy](https://chatbuddy2025.onrender.com/) **Options** menu.

## üõ†Ô∏è How the Memory System Works

The AI can manage its own memory based on your conversation. The App listens for specific JSON commands within its responses.

```json
{
  "action": "remember",
  "target": "The user's name is Alex and they are a software developer.",
}
```

-   `"action"`: Can be `remember`, `forget`, `update`, or `temp`.
-   `"target"`: The piece of information to act upon.

This allows for dynamic and context-aware conversations that evolve over time. You can view and manage all permanent memories from the "Saved Memories" modal.

**Memory is handled by `Gemma3-12b-it`**.

## üìú Source Code

The application source code (frontend and backend) is available on GitHub. Fork it, modify it, and make it your own. If you find it useful, please consider giving it a star! The codebase has been improved for readability, making it easier for open-source contributors to get involved.
